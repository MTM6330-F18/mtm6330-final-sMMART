# Final Project: Starter Repo

You can use this repository as the base for your final group project.

1. Copy the entire contents into your project folder

2. Run `npm install` in the terminal (in your project folder)

3. Activate Gulp in watch mode with the `gulp` command in the terminal

## Override Bootstrap variables

Remember in order to overrirde the default Bootstrap styling, you need to set the appropriate Sass variables at the top of your `main.scss` file. The starter code includes a couple of examples.

## Suggested Structure

1. Keep everything that applies to multiple pages in the `main.scss` file.

2. Create a Sass partial for styles that apply to only one page/layout. e.g. `_schedule.scss` would have the styles unique to the `schedule.html` page.

## Dont't forget to activate GitHub Pages on your repository!

From your repository's settings page on GitHub, scroll down to the _GitHub Pages_ section and select the **master branch** from the drop-down menu, and then click the [Save] button right next to it.
